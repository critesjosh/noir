## Getting help

There are many ways you can get help when you're stuck. The best way to get started is by asking for help in the #noir

## Contributing to the Standard Library

Noir is still very new and there are many cryptographic primitives that we have yet to build that will be useful for the community.
Here are few ideas. If you have other ideas, please reach out on the [Aztec Discord](https://discord.gg/aztec) to discuss.

- Poseidon hashing
- Keccack hashing
- SHA512 hashing
- ECDSA: verify and sign
- EDDSA: verify and sign

Future (once Noir has bigint support):

- RSA
- Elliptic curve arithmetic
